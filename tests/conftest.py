            "the inﬂammatory microenvironment of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease"
            " (MASLD) has been posited as crucial. Bletilla striata polysaccharides (BSPs),"
            " extracted from the tubers of Bletilla striata (Thunb.) Rchb.f., exhibit signiﬁcant"
            " anti-inﬂammatory properties. However, their potential protective effects "
            "on MASLD and their role in regulating pyroptosis remain unclear.\n"
            "Objectives: This study investigates the efﬁcacy of BSP-1, a puriﬁed "
            "metabolite isolated from crude BSPs, on MASLD by evaluating its ability"
            " to modulate the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway.\n"
            "Methods: To simulate MASLD in vivo and in vitro, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced"
            " rat models and free fatty acid (FFA)-stimulated HepG2 cells were used. "
            "Serum indicators and histopathological staining were employed to assess "
            "liver injury and lipid deposition. Additionally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent "
            "assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunoﬂuorescence, real-time quantitative"
            " polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blotting (WB) analysis"
            " were conducted to examine the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway and related cytokine levels.\n"
            "Results: BSP-1 signiﬁcantly ameliorates alanine aminotransferase (ALT), "
            "aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride "
            "(TG) levels in both rat serum and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, BSP-1 reduces "
            "inﬂammatory factors interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, while improving pathological "
            "changes in rat liver tissue. Mechanistically, BSP-1 regulates the expression of"
